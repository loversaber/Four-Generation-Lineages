# Four-Generation-Lineages
#### The Transmission of Mitochondrial DNA in Four-Generation Lineages. We used 16 healthy four-generation lineages which contained great-grandmother (GGM), grandmother (GM), mother (MO) and daughter/son (OF), and aimed to explore the pattern of mtDNA transmission in multiple generations. I have analyzed the mutation pattern and calculated the bottleneck size in the transmission based on a maximum-likelihood estimation model. All the analysis has been done and the paper is been writing.
